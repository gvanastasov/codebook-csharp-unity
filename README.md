# Unity CSharp Playbook

## Overview

Welcome to the Unity CSharp Playbook! This project is a hands-on guide designed to help beginners explore C# programming within the Unity engine. It's not a standalone game, but an interactive playbook that provides a practical, engaging way to learn C# and Unity - directly inside Unity Editor itself. Expect to have interaction with console, code and inspector. A good idea is to navigate a bit around Unity before starting this up (aka at least know that Unity is game engine, click around read intro from their website - I might add an interactive guide around the editor since i believe we have interface to tap into the rendering of different windows).

The project uses a single scene, with a GameManager to navigate between different chapters and their subdivisions, referred to as chapter parts. A helpful editor is included in the SceneView to assist with managing CRUD operations. Why single scene? Why not :)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2022.3 or later installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gvanastasov/UnityCSharpPlaybook.git`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the game in editor mode.

### Usage

1. Hit Play!
2. Navigate between chapters and parts using the game navigation.
3. Explore the console, scene, and scripts to learn about C# and Unity.

> **NOTE**: There is some hardcoded logic behind the names of chapters and parts. If you decide to edit them, you risk breaking something. However, experimentation is a great way to learn. To manage chapters and parts, use the `Chapter Manager` which can be toggled via `Window/Custom Tools/Chapter Manager`.
